## Leaving our Campsite at Kayak Point Regional County Park

{% include youtube.html id="mMVK-WTIAt4" %}

We had a great weekend camping over the Presidents Day weekend.  Saturday was dry, but it rained pretty steady Sunday.  

Kayak Point Regional County Park is open year-round and offers ten yurts and 30 partial-utility (water/power) in mostly large, wooded campsites with privacy not found in most campgrounds.  They have heated bathrooms with showers.  This is the place where we tend to start our camping season.  We dry camp (no water in the system) this time of year since it can still drop below freezing.  Good thing since the temperatures have been in the 20's (fahrenheit)the week following this trip.
