##  Pairing Voyager WiSight 2.0 Backup Camera

### Pair, Plug-in, Depart

This video was really helpful to me tonight to pair the Voyager WiSight 2.0 Backup Camera on our Airstream.  It is focused on the camera being used on trucks but the advice is the same for the Airstream.  What is important is the order.  Pair, Plug-in, Depart.

I was having a problem getting the pairing to work. Here is the order to get setup and not be frustrated by the process:

**Prereqs:**

* Start your tow vehicle and turn the headlights on.
 
      `This is going to provide power to the device screen in the vehicle as well as for the backup camera powered through the running lights on the Airstream.`

* Make sure you seven pin plug is not plugged into the tow vehicle

      `You need to plug your trailer into the 7 pin but only after you have started the pairing on the device screen, so start with the trailer not plugged in.`

**Pair:**

* Now you are going to hold the pair button for 5 seconds to start the paring countdown

**Plug-in:**

* Before the 50 second pairing countdown is complete, plug-in the 7 pin on your tow vehicle to provide power to the trailer and the backup camera so it can initialize pairing.

**Depart**

* This should complete the pairing and you are ready to depart.

**Note Proximity is everything when pairing**

`If it does not work perhaps plug the device screen into another vehicle that is closer to the backup camera so it is in closer proximity.  Same steps, but the only difference is that the second vehicle is powering the device screen where you start the pairing and the tow vehicle is powering the trailer running lights and backup camera where you plug the trailer into the 7 pin after starting the pairing process from the second vehicle.  After it pairs you can move the device screen back in the tow vehicle and plug it in.`
