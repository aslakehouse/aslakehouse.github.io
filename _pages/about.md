Airstream Lakehouse is a blog site for us to post interesting stories and photos as we go camping and travel with our 3 dogs (Hudson, Harlow, and Baby) in our 2023 Airstream International 23FB Twin bed. We were so happy to get our Airstream in September of 2022.  We managed to take a couple trips before winter weather set in, and are hoping to start using it again really soon.
